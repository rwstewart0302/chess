### TODO:
### - CLEANOUT ALL PRINTS AND INPUTS WHEN PYGAME IS IMPLEMENTED
### - ADD SOME PRINT STATEMENTS FOR INVALID PIECE SELECTIONS
### - CLEANUP MAIN FILE ---> MAKE VARIABLES AND LOOPS MORE READABLE
### - DEFINE CHESS_BOARD.PY FUNCTION TO HANDLE PYGAME STUFF
### - GIVE A CONDITION TO PIECE_MOVEMENT.PY FOR CASTLING AND STALEMATE!!!
### - DONT FORGET KING/KING STALEMATE AND THREEFOLD REPITION
